# Frequently Asked Questions

## How does photo scanning work?

Capturing photos with Heirloom is simple. Hold your phone over the image. Make sure the *entire photo* is visible in the viewer. Tap the shutter. Heirloom will automatically find the edges of the photo and produce a high quality scan in less than one second.

## How do I avoid shadows and glare on my pictures?

Avoid direct overhead light. If you are seeing your shadow or reflection in the image, simply tilt the phone and move to a position that removes the glare. Even if your phone is at a slight angle, Heirloom will correct that and produce a good scan.

For the best image quality when scanning photos from albums, peel back the protective coating.

## How do I upload a photo?

On the Capture screen, tap the small thumbnail to the left of the shutter button. You can select a photo from your camera roll (iOS) or gallery (Android) to upload.

## How do I rotate a photo?

Immediately after you scan, you’ll see your cropped image. If the orientation is not correct, simply tap the button on the far right of the Edit screen (two arrows, forming a circle) until the photo appears correctly.

If you saved a photo with the incorrect orientation, see the question just below: ‘Can I edit a photo after it has been scanned and saved?’

## iOS: I’m seeing a black screen on Capture

If you are seeing a black screen on Capture, please take the following steps:

## Why does the Heirloom app ask for access to my camera and photos?

Apple requires that we do this. We need access to your camera so you have the ability to scan photos. Our capture screen will not work unless you grant the app access.

We ask for access to photos so that you can upload photos to Heirloom, or save photos from Heirloom to your camera roll. We will never pull photos from your camera roll without your explicit permission. We will also never use your content without your explicit permission - for advertising or any other purpose.

## Why does the Heirloom app ask for access to my contacts?

We ask for access to contacts to enable you to invite friends and family to view photos. We will never contact anyone without your permission, or do anything with your contacts without your explicit permission.
