# FAQ

## Getting Started

### How do I get started?

1. Once you have installed Heirloom on your smartphone, make sure you have a stable internet or network connection (WiFi / 3G / 4G / LTE)
2. Sign-up to create your account and tap ‘Submit’.
3. Understanding the main menu:
  * Moments: This is where all scanned or uploaded photos will appear.
  * Albums: Albums are for organizing your photos.
  * Groups: Groups are for sharing photos privately with friends and family.
  * Capture: This is where you scan your photos. You can also upload a photo from your camera roll here.
4. iOS users: You’ll see a prompt asking to allow Heirloom access to your camera. Please tap ‘Yes’. You will not be able to scan photos if you deny the app access to your camera.
5. Start by tapping 'Capture’. Here are a few tips to ensure a successful photo scan:
  * Before tapping the orange shutter, make sure that all four edges / corners of the photo are fully visible. If part of the photo is cut off from the phone’s camera, Heirloom will likely produce a strange result.
  * Make sure there is enough contrast between the photo and its background (for example, Heirloom may fail to accurately identify the edges of a dark photo sitting on a dark table).
6. Hit the shutter button and if you are happy with the result, hit 'Save'. You can continue scanning or you can exit the Capture menu and view your photo in 'Moments'.

## Scanning photos

### How does photo scanning work?

Capturing photos with Heirloom is simple. Hold your phone over the image. Make sure the entire photo is visible in the viewer. Tap the shutter. Heirloom will automatically find the edges of the photo and produce a high quality scan in less than one second.

Here are a few tips to ensure a successful photo scan:

1. Before tapping the orange shutter, make sure that all four edges / corners of the photo are fully visible. If part of the photo is cut off from the phone’s camera, Heirloom will likely produce a strange result.
2. Make sure there is enough contrast between the photo and its background (for example, Heirloom may fail to accurately identify the edges of a dark photo sitting on a dark table).
3. Avoid overhead lights.

### How do I avoid shadows and glare on my pictures?

Avoid direct overhead light. If you are seeing your shadow or reflection in the image, simply tilt the phone and move into a position that removes the glare. Even if your phone is at a slight angle, Heirloom will correct that and produce a flat image with no distortion.

For the best image quality when scanning photos from albums, peel back any protective coating. If your photo is in a frame, we recommend removing it.

### Why is Heirloom scanning just a portion of my photo?

When Heirloom only captures half the image, there are a couple of possibilities:

  * Make sure you move away from the photo in order to view all four corners / edges of the photo in the viewer before you tap the orange button.
  * Ensure that you have some contrast between the photo and the background. (For example, a dark photo sitting on a dark table may fail in this way).

### Can I take a normal picture with Heirloom’s ‘capture’ tool?

Not yet. This feature will be available in the near future. For now, our ‘Capture’ screen is designed for fast photo scanning.

## Importing and exporting photos

### How do I import an existing photo from my smartphone to Heirloom?

3. You can select a photo from your camera roll (iOS) or gallery (Android) to upload.
Tap ‘Save’ to confirm.

### Why does Heirloom ask for access to my camera and photos?

Apple requires that we do this. We need access to your camera so you have the ability to scan photos. Our scanner will not work unless you grant the app access.

We ask for access to photos so that you can upload photos to Heirloom, or save photos from Heirloom to your camera roll. We will never pull photos from your camera roll without your explicit permission. We will also never use your content without your explicit permission - for advertising or any other purpose.

### Why does Heirloom ask for access to my contacts?

We ask for access to contacts to enable you to invite friends and family to view photos. We will never contact anyone without your permission, or do anything with your contacts without your explicit permission.

1. Go to www.heirloom.net from your computer and sign in with your Heirloom username and password.
2. When you scroll over a photo in Moments, you’ll notice a checkmark.

## Photo quality and printing

### Does Heirloom offer printing services?

Heirloom does not currently offer printing services.

### What is the resolution of my scanned photos? What is displayed on my phone?

We scan at the full resolution of your device camera. The actual DPI depends on the resolution of the camera and the size of the photo being scanned. For something like an iPhone 4 or better and a 4 x 6 inch photo (10.2 x 15.2 cm), the DPI is around 600. We store this high-resolution version of your scan and make it available at www.heirloom.net.

There are a couple of additional points here:

  * 600DPI is greater than the resolution typically available in a photo print.
  * Although some scanners advertise a higher DPI, when you actually measure them, they don't resolve anything like this. Tests have shown Heirloom easily outperforms an average desktop scanner for all photo sizes up to 8x10 inches (20.3 x 25.4 cm).

On your phone's display:
We currently display a lower resolution that, for a 4 x 6 inch photo (10.2 x 15.2 cm), would work out as a display version of 215DPI. This is as much resolution as you typically can get out of a 4 x 6 photo print (10.2 x 15.2 cm).

Therefore, when sharing a scanned photo, the recipient will get the exact same resolution as the one displayed on your phone.

### What is the quality of photos available at heirloom.net?

You can download high-resolution versions of your photos at www.heirloom.net. The photos are available at their full resolution.
