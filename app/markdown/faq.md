# Frequently Asked Questions

## How does photo scanning work?

Capturing photos with Heirloom is simple. Hold your phone over the image. Make sure the entire photo is visible in the viewer. Tap the shutter. Heirloom will automatically find the edges of the photo and produce a high quality scan in less than one second.

## How do I avoid shadows and glare on my pictures?

Avoid direct overhead light. If you are seeing your shadow or reflection in the image, simply tilt the phone and move to a position that removes the glare. Even if your phone is at a slight angle, Heirloom will correct that and produce a good scan.

For the best image quality when scanning photos from albums, peel back the protective coating.

## How do I upload a photo?

On the Capture screen, tap the small thumbnail to the left of the shutter button. You can select a photo from your camera roll to upload.

## Can I edit a photo after it has been scanned and saved?

Not yet. Please be sure to make the edits you want to make (rotate the image, add a filter, etc.) immediately after the image has been scanned. We plan to make image editing available from the Moments screen in the near future.

## How do I take a normal picture with the camera?

This feature will be available in the near future. For now, our Capture screen is designed for fast photo scanning.
