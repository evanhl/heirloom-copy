		  Please read this carefully.  It affects your rights.  YOU AND
		HEIRLOOM AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES,
		PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE
		TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL
		CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION, EXCEPT
		AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF
		OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.  Arbitration
		is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a
		neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more
		limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited
		review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and
		relief that a court can award.  Please visit <A HREF="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</A>
